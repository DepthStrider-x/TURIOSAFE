      <h3>About India</h3>
      <p>A country with a rich and colourful history, India is home to some of the world’s most fascinating cultures.
        India is a country located in South Asia and the capital of India is New Delhi. The Government of India, the
        Constitutional Republic represents a highly diverse population of thousands of ethnic groups and the many
        languages spoken in the country.</p>

      <p>According to the Population Reference Bureau (PRB), it has a population of over 1.2 billion, making it the
        second-most populous country in the world. Built-in approximately 9,000 years ago, India was largely
        self-contained and became a cultural arena associated with Hinduism. The roots of this tradition can be traced
        to the Indus civilization.</p>

      <p>Other religions such as Buddhism and Jainism originated in India, where Buddhism spread throughout Asia, while
        both religions are quite popular in the subcontinent. India has also developed a rich intellectual life in such
        fields as astronomy, fine art, architecture, mathematics, and music.</p>

      <p>The country has been recognized for its economic development since gaining independence in 1947. It has become
        the seventh-largest country in the world, and it is geographically distinct from other Asian nations because of
        its location between mountains and the sea. India is a country of many contrasts, from the Indian Ocean to
        snow-capped peaks and the deserts in Rajasthan to the green forests of Kerala.</p>

      <h3>History of India</h3>
      <p>India’s history can be broken down into three major phases. The first phase is the ancient period known as
        Ancient India, which covers thousands of years that began when humans first settled in India. This period
        includes the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300-1300 BCE), which is considered one of the world’s oldest
        civilizations and a precursor to modern Indian culture.</p>

      <p>In medieval India, a period in Indian history is seen as lasting from the ancient period to the Mughal Empire.
        This long period begins in the 6th century AD and ends in 1526 when the empire was established. Some historians
        believe that it started later than these dates and ended earlier.</p>

      <p>In the early 20th century, India was also experiencing a period of change. In 1857, the Indian independence
        movement began in Bengal with the first nationalistic revolutionary movement. The British Empire controlled
        India at this time and it lasted until 1947 when India gained its independence.</p>

      <h3>Culture of India</h3>
      <p>India has a rich cultural heritage, reflected in its diverse population. The country’s culture has been shaped
        by various external and internal influences. Over the centuries, India has seen a significant fusion of Hindus,
        Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists. These religions are collectively known as Indian religions as they
        originated in India.</p>

      <p>“Unity in diversity” – these are words that do not just hold meaning but can be applied to a country like
        India. From the time of the Mauryas, Cholas and Mughals to the period of the British Empire, India has always
        been famous for its traditions and hospitality.</p>

      <p>Due to warm relations and a sense of celebration, India has a special place in the global community. Its
        vibrant culture is an amalgamation of religions, festivals, food, arts, crafts and dance. The country is
        vibrant, and eclectic, and attracts many tourists for its culture. Popularly known as the land of God, the
        country of India has everything from culture to values, customs and traditions that define its beauty.</p>

      <p>Also, explore the beauty of Indian Tribes that add colour and beauty to the culture of India.</p>
